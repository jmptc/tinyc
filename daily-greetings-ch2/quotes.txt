“If you can do one thing, hone it to perfection. Hone it to the utmost limit.”
“Growing old and dying is what gives meaning and beauty to the fleeting span of a human life. It’s precisely because we age and die that our lives have value and nobility.”
No Matter How Devastated You May Be By Your Own Weakness Or Uselessness Set Your Heart Ablaze.
It's All Right To Cry. It's All Right To Run Away. Just Don't Ever Give Up.

Don’t Ever Give Up. Even If It’s Painful, Even If It’s Agonizing, Don’t Try To Take the Easy Way Out.
